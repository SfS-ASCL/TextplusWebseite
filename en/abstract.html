        <p> Text+ focuses on text- and language-based research data with a special emphasis on
            Digital Collections, Lexical Resources (incl. dictionaries) and Editions. These three
            data domains have a long tradition in Humanities research and have given rise to mature
            methodological paradigms that require distinctive, yet cross-cutting practices of
            research data creation, curation and management. The three types of research data are
            crucial for a wide range of Humanities disciplines, including, but not limited to,
            Linguistics, Literary Studies, Cultural Studies, History, Philosophy, and language-based
            and text-based research in the Social and Political Sciences.</p>
        <p> The Text+ institutions jointly represent most, if not all relevant stakeholders that
            contribute research data in the Humanities: research libraries, universities, Digital
            Humanities data centres, members of the Union of German Academies of Arts and Sciences,
            and members of non-university research organisations, including Leibniz Institutes and
            Max-Planck Institutes. The Text+ initiative includes major computing centres that will
            ensure strong and persistent infrastructure services for a distributed research data
            infrastructure. All Text+ institutions provide substantial in-kind contributions,
            thereby signalling their strong support for Text+. Support from the communities of
            interest is documented by the large number of <a href="participants.html">participants</a> and
            of <a href="supporting.html">supporting parties</a>.</p>
        <p> The governance model of Text+ fosters joint responsibility and consensus building among
            infrastructure providers and infrastructure users as well as collaboration across
            disciplinary boundaries. At the core of this governance model, three Scientific
            Coordination Committees and one Operations Coordination Committee will continuously
            evaluate the Text+ portfolio of data, tools, and services and will be instrumental in
            extending the Text+ portfolio in line with priorities set by the communities of
            interest. </p>
        <p> Text+ maintains close ties with relevant international initiatives so as to benefit from
            mutual synergies and to help shape major initiatives such as EOSC, EUDAT, OpenAire, and
            RDA. </p>
        <p> The research data management strategy of Text+ is the guideline and the core instrument
            to implement the main objectives of Text+ and to achieve the aims of the NFDI programme.
            The RDM strategy defines the fundamental path towards the integration of data,
            applications, tools, and services into a standards-based infrastructure adhering to FAIR
            principles, and it describes processes to maintain and evolve this infrastructure. </p>
        <p> The work programme of Text+ is divided into five task areas: the task area
            Administration, one task area for each of the three data domains, as well as the task
            area Infrastructure/Operations, whose measures closely interact with the measures in the
            three data domains. More specifically, this close cooperation is realised by three types
            of cross-cutting measures concerning community, data, and software services. </p>
